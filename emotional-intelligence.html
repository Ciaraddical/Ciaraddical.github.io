        <strong> What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong> <br>
        When we describe someone as emotionally intelligent, we’re referring to their ability to recognise their emotions and those of others. Although we can’t always control what emotions we feel, being aware of them can be the first step to regulating them. Empathy is far easier once we are able to understand what others may be feeling - this also helps judge the mood of groups. We are influenced by the emotions and actions of those around us, so being able to read a room, or pick up on potential conflicts before they escalate, is a good skill to have.
        <br>
        Our emotional intelligence often stems from our parents’ behaviour - the first people to model social interactions for us when we’re young - even if we were too young to consciously remember. However, “EQ” can also be taught. Anger management classes are a good example of this -teaching how to recognise our emotions and find less harmful ways of dealing with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong><br>
        IQ is widely considered to test how “smart” someone is. However, it tests a limited field of knowledge - mostly analytical abilities and logical problem solving.
IQ tests can also have the flaw of being biased towards test-takers with a particular upbringing - such as growing up within a western culture. It’s hard to test for knowledge people “should know”, such as current politicians, or historical events, without falling into this bias.
<br>
It’s widely accepted nowadays that, although useful, this is not the only type of knowledge with value - working well with others, and even navigating most facets of everyday life, are made easier if you are able to empathise and relate to others - social, or emotional intelligence.
     </p>
     <p>
       <strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>
       Although humans are capable of incredible things individually, I feel like our greatest achievements result from many people working together. However, in order to work together effectively, we need more than just IQ. Emotional intelligence can optimise our social interactions, play a vital role in self-development, and result in higher productivity.
      <br>
      Often I would prefer to be around someone who is easy to get along with (aka emotionally intelligent) rather than someone with a high IQ. Even if I’m working on a problem with someone else with a really high IQ, if they don’t have the skills to effectively communicate their ideas in a way I’ll understand, it’ll be really hard to work together. I know that if I feel this way, it’s likely others do too, including people I might like to be employed by.
