    <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
    <h3>21 April 2022</h3>
    <p>
      These terms describe a way of arranging elements, such as paragraphs, images, or buttons, on a webpage. 
      Inline elements, like links, will display on the same line on a website, and can have items either side. 
      Inline elements are unable to be given heights, so that they won't disrupt the arrangement of the lines around them.
      </p>
      <p>The opposite of inline elements are block elements.
      Block elements will always stack on top of each other (like a stack of toy blocks), even if there's room to fit side by side. 
      They can be given height, and they will default to displaying 100% wide - taking up the whole page.
      Elements have a default display mode - for example, paragraphs are block elements, because it makes sense for new paragraphs to be on a new line, and blocks will force a new line.
      </p>
      <p>
      Inline-block takes attributes from both inline and block (as the name might suggest).
      Elements can be displayed on the same line, but their size can be modified to a much greater extent than inline elements. 
      Inline-block is used often in nav-bars, to display buttons side-by-side, but there's a lot of different uses it could be put to.
     </p> 
     <p>All hail inline-block.
