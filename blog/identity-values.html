Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action. 

During the August lockdown in 2021, I decided to get back in touch with a friend from highschool - we’d had a bit of a friendship break up in our final year, but I was conscious of how much I’d changed in the four years since then, and I wanted to find out if she had also changed, and if there was an opportunity to reconnect. 

We chatted for about two weeks, but then she stopped replying. This had been a common situation when we were in high school, and I got the sense that she was struggling a bit with anxiety and felt anxious about replying after too much time had passed. 
I had a lot of feelings about it, mostly tied up in how we’d behaved towards each other in school, and I ended up writing it all out in my diary.
I wrote about how I wasn’t sure I could forgive her for some things, but I’d like to try forget them and start anew.

I ended up sending her the diary entry, so that she knew exactly how I felt. I got a lot of peace from being so explicitly open about how I felt, but I didn’t receive a reply.
In the letter I’d also talked about how I planned to keep reaching out to her unless she actually asked me to stop, because I knew the reason she wasn’t replying was probably nothing to do with me and more about how she was feeling.
I kept reaching out for maybe the next two weeks, but it took a bit of energy from me every time I extended myself and got no reply. Eventually, I sent a message saying that while I was always available if she needed something, I couldn’t keep reaching out like that.
It was a hard decision to make - it felt like abandoning someone who probably needed support and a friend to talk to, but at the same time, I knew that it wasn’t a constructive thing for me personally to be doing - sometimes it felt like talking to a brick wall, and I was also struggling a bit with my own depression during lockdown.
I’d done all I could but to keep trying with nothing changing seemed useless.

When I was back home for Christmas, I got in touch again and suggested we catch up in person. We grabbed a coffee together, and had a good chat, but didn’t touch on a lot of the stuff I’d mentioned in my letter. She told me the reason she’d stopped replying was due to some things happening in her own life and had nothing to do with me, and that she was really grateful I’d been so persistent. She told me she’d actually written a letter as a reply to mine but not felt confident enough to send it, then promised to send it when she got home.

When we parted, she stopped replying again. I didn’t receive the letter, and I was really disappointed. I’d got my hopes up that we would be friends again, but it didn’t happen.
I still have no idea why that is, but I keep sending the odd message about a film I’ll watch or something I’ve seen, just in case she replies. 

Although this seems contradictory to the previous choice I made, I think it aligns closer to my values of kindness and persistence. I no longer invest so much energy into these messages, or care too much about whether there’s a response, but I feel like I’m keeping my word, and hopefully when she’s ready she’ll reply. I feel like while I have the mental energy to be doing it, it’s the right thing to do, and it makes me feel better about myself.


Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. 
I feel like culture has a few potential meanings.
In terms of a wider ethnic culture -
My background is that my mother was pakeha, and my father is irish.
I feel like pakeha culture in New Zealand suffers a bit from disconnect with our ancestors or culture. I find it hard sometimes to be proud of an ancestry which depends on stolen land and exploitation, although obviously there's a lot more nuance than that. One thing I am proud of is the leap into the unknown so many early settlers took.
On the other hand, I feel a lot of connection to my Irish ancestry, particularly because I lived in Ireland for two years. I play Irish traditional music, and I enjoy the feeling of knowing that I’m continuing a tradition that has lasted hundreds of years, and contributing to that tradition.
I think that there are also aspects of Irish culture I’m proud to embody - love of fun, being a good host, a massive history of storytellers and poets.
The multicultural aspect of this lineage is something I’ve struggled with sometimes. When I was in Ireland, I didn’t feel Irish - I felt like a Kiwi. But when I came home, I no longer felt like a Kiwi - I had an accent, and people would ask me where I was really from (which was admittedly hilarious). 
However, I feel like this heritage has given me much more awareness of how people’s opinions are shaped by where they’re from, and a lot more tolerance for people I don’t fully understand, as a result.

In terms of a family culture growing up-
I grew up in an environment that rewarded hard work, and academic achievement. I frequently associate achievement or external validation with self worth as a result, which I’ve only recently become aware of. I don’t think it’s an entirely bad thing, but self knowledge is always useful.
I also grew up in a very musical household, and I think that this resulted in valuing the ability to entertain others, whether that’s with music or humour.
I’m very close to my family, and I think this has set me up to really value close connections with people. I feel like when I’m in a group of people, it’s greater than the sum of its parts, and that’s one of my favourite things about humanity, honestly.

Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
Strengths:
Communication
I’m aware that I’m fortunate enough to be able to convey the way that I think and feel with a lot of accuracy. I’m able to use language to express meaning and beauty, and I love that about myself. I know that this is something many others struggle with, so it’d be good to explore the ways in which I can use my strength in this to help others, without speaking for them or over them.

Networking
I’m good with people (a gross generalisation). I’m able to present a version of myself that’s likeable, and use humour as a way to break the ice. In an extension of the “everyone has something to teach you” maxim, I think that most people also enjoy the feeling of having taught or given someone else something really valuable. I like to ask people a lot of questions, find a topic they have expertise on, and learn from them. Even if what I learn isn’t useful or I already know it, it’s an opportunity to make a connection with someone, and it means that they’ll likely remember me. 

Quick learner
I read and absorb information at a really high speed, and while this doesn’t always equate to instant ability, I think it does give me an edge in a lot of cases. Because I’ve read a lot, I also tend to recognise a lot of patterns in things like etymology and recognition of themes and motifs in literature. I’m curious to see if this transfers well into the tech field - if I can apply memory and prior knowledge to problem solving and troubleshooting.

Limitations:
My pride makes it hard to ask for help and express vulnerability- I often want to  protect my image as someone who’s always competent and in control. I think that if I’m a student it feels easier to ask for help - the frameworks are all set up and I know that it’s the smart thing to do.
Procrastination - I sometimes delay easy tasks for ridiculous amounts of time. I find it hard to motivate myself to do boring tasks without time pressure. I’m sure that this will surface during the time of the course, but I’m confident that the motivation of learning as much as possible in order to find a job at the end will help wit this, and I got a lot out of the prep materials which talked about methods of time management.
Impatience - this varies depending on my mental state - it’s a sign I need to do something in life differently if I notice I’m becoming frustrated easily or have less tolerance for others’ mistakes. Usually the fix involves exercising or meditating, but even at the best of times I’m aware that I tend towards impatience - I like to think that I channel this into being as efficient as practical.



Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
I think that my communication skills are going to be really helpful in group work - I’m normally quite good at working with others towards a goal. I’m aware that bootcamp can be quite an intense and stressful experience, so I’d like to use these skills to be able to start discussions with members of my cohort and homegroup about how we’re all doing, and seeing if we can help each other out.
I’d like to use my networking skills to learn from other students as much as possible, and identify who has expertise on particular topics. I know that there’s people from a very wide range of backgrounds on the course, and I think that particularly for projects, playing towards strengths and covering each others blind spots could be the best approach.
I’d like to use my ability to learn to find out more about all the different career options - front end, app development, etc, and research more about anything that interests me, and that I’d like to specialise in. Currently I’m quite interested in the software behind audio-reactive visuals, as I’ve used a few different types before, but I expect my horizons will be broadened considerably over the next four months.


Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
When I was working in a lighting warehouse, we often hired local crew to load trucks if it was a busy day, so that we could prep equipment. Someone has to oversee them, and I’d met some people that were quite good at it, but I struggled a bit. I tried to tell four men, all older than me, some of them by a significant amount, that the easiest way to load the truck would be to start loading cases from the sides and then work their way in, so they had more room to work. I was promptly ignored, and rather than stressing the point, I figured that if they wanted to make it harder for themselves, so be it.
I didn’t lose much sleep over it - I was told that the more you work with local crew, the better you get, and I didn’t have much experience at the time.
If I were to do it again, I think I would’ve made more of an effort to connect with the guys before telling them what to do - I didn’t even get their names I think, it was a busy day. 
Watching others work with local crew later on, I paid more attention to how they handled it, and being able to have a laugh around with them definitely made cooperation easier.
Five minutes of small talk might’ve made a difference, or it might not have. 
There were plenty of people who didn’t want to be told what to do by a nineteen year old girl, and I tended to make more of an effort with people I’d be working with long term.
