            <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong> <br><br>
Long-term goal is to be a professional software developer - I’m not yet sure what I’d like to specialise in - possibly something that will play to my comms strengths, such as an analyst or consultant. 
I want to be good enough that I can ask to work remotely, eventually part-time. I have the dream of being a digital nomad.
I know that one way to reach this point is to learn something that not many others know, rather than to try be the best in a massive field.
<br>I’d like to see coding less as work and more as something enjoyable - I want to want to work on projects in my free time
<br><br><strong>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</strong><br><br>
My strengths include good communication, enthusiasm, a tendency to obsess about a passion, and I'm a quick learner.
Limitations include innate procrastination urges, reluctance to admit difficulty, depressive episodes involving self sabotage<br><br>
<strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong><br><br>
I’d like to be able to facilitate multiple people working together, and create safe spaces for peers who might be too shy or nervous to contribute otherwise.     
Already I feel like my time management has improved since starting this course - I’d like to learn more about my learning and working styles in order to maximize productivity while staying sane.
 <br><br>   
<strong>A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</strong><br><br>
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives: <br><br>
Find effective tools to manage weaknesses - eg pomodoro for productivity<br>
Clearly express boundaries and expectations before getting frustrated at others for what they’re unaware of<br><br>
What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you<br><br>
Maintain other priorities alongside productivity - sleeping, eating, and exercising<br>
Take a walk - be outside and away from tech for half an hour<br>
Talk about it - reach out to others on the course (if they have the energy for it) or to my brother - discuss challenges and gain perspective<br>
Reach out for help - admit difficulty to facilitators, or someone able to help. <br><br>
A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way<br><br>
-If I need help, my first step will be to post in the relevant discord channel - I may get an answer from a peer or I might find several people are struggling with the same thing.<br>
-the second step would be to get in touch with a facilitator, and have a chat or a call with them about it.<br>
-I’d like to keep the process the same regardless of whether it’s a tech problem or more of a personal problem - I think that being open about struggles is worthwhile for the reassurance it brings others that they’re not alone if they’re struggling too.<br>
-The “if you’re stuck on it for more than twenty minutes get help” rule has worked well for code problems so far - I might extend that to something like 24 hours for personal problems, or maybe just after sleeping on it - can see what a facilitator recommends here.<br><br>
A description of what you expect from the facilitation team<br><br>
From the facilitation team, I expect a willingness to help overcome obstacles, a reference point for the relevance of what I’m learning, someone to tell me when I’m overthinking stuff, and at least one decent joke per week
