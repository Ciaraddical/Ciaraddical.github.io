            What is your long term goal or career pathway?
Long-term goal is to be a professional software developer - I’m not yet sure what I’d like to specialise in - possibly something that will play to my comms strengths, such as an analyst or consultant. 
I want to be good enough that I can ask to work remotely, eventually part-time. I have the dream of being a digital nomad.
I know that one way to reach this point is to learn something that not many others know, rather than to try be the best in a massive field.
I’d like to see coding less as work and more as something enjoyable - I want to want to work on projects in my free time
A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning
Strengths include good communication, tendency to obsess about a passion, quick learner, enthusiastic.
Limitations include innate procrastination urges, reluctance to admit difficulty, depressive episodes involving self sabotage
What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
I’d like to be able to facilitate multiple people working together, and create safe spaces for peers who might be too shy or nervous to contribute otherwise.     
Already I feel like my time management has improved since starting this course - I’d like to learn more about my learning and working styles in order to maximize productivity while staying sane.
    
A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives
Find effective tools to manage weaknesses - eg pomodoro for productivity
Clearly express boundaries and expectations before getting frustrated at others for what they’re unaware of
What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
Maintain other priorities alongside productivity - sleeping, eating, and exercising
Take a walk - be outside and away from tech for half an hour
Talk about it - reach out to others on the course (if they have the energy for it) or to my brother - discuss challenges and gain perspective
Reach out for help - admit difficulty to facilitators, or someone able to help. 
A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
-If I need help, my first step will be to post in the relevant discord channel - I may get an answer from a peer or I might find several people are struggling with the same thing.
-the second step would be to get in touch with a facilitator, and have a chat or a call with them about it.
-I’d like to keep the process the same regardless of whether it’s a tech problem or more of a personal problem - I think that being open about struggles is worthwhile for the reassurance it brings others that they’re not alone if they’re struggling too.
-The “if you’re stuck on it for more than twenty minutes get help” rule has worked well for code problems so far - I might extend that to something like 24 hours for personal problems, or maybe just after sleeping on it - can see what a facilitator recommends here.
A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
From the facilitation team, I expect a willingness to help overcome obstacles, a reference point for the relevance of what I’m learning, someone to tell me when I’m overthinking stuff, and at least one decent joke per week
Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
