        <h2>Foundations Reflections</h2>
        <h3>16 May 2022</h3>
        <strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
        </strong> 
        <p>1- a lot of my identity revolves around being seen to be smart - I find struggling to learn something really challenging
        </p>
        <p>2- I find helping others learn really rewarding - it increases my self-image in a constructive way
        </p>
        <p>3- I get a far greater sense of satisfaction when I solve something if I’ve struggled with it - the struggle seems worth it for the endorphin hit
        </p>
        
        <strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
       </strong> 
       <p>Values - I feel that if we have a clear understanding of our values and motivations we can approach something - 
         a project, or a problem, with more intent and self awareness. This aids in maintaining focus and encourages altruism
       </p>
       <p>Empathy - one of the keys to successful cooperation, the ability to step into someone else’s shoes is also useful while learning - 
         understanding the difference between how people learn also fosters self-compassion and a growth mindset.
       </p>
       <p>Self-awareness - programming seems to almost invariably lead to self-awareness - 
         we stare at code we imagine to be flawless for hours before someone else points out a mistake, and the realisation that we are viewing something with  warped senses falls into place.
         The value of self awareness in learning is equally vital - the ability to recognise patterns in the way we respond to 
         problems, stressors, and frustrations is the first step towards redirecting these responses in a more positive and constructive direction.
       </p>

       <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
       </strong>
       <p>I feel like core learning has filled gap in my knowledge that has been there for a while -
          ways to approach new knowledge, increase productivity, and deal with challenges - these were all things I had previously seen as somewhat hardwired.
         </p>
       <p>I feel like without the core curriculum I would have struggled significantly more with the volume of information we’re expected to learn,
           as well as the experience of self directed remote learning.</p>

           <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
           </strong>
           <p>
             It’s brought to light that a lot of the excuses I’ve been leaning on are actually surmountable problems, and that ultimately, I’m responsible for my successes and failures.
              This is a somewhat uncomfortable truth, and I’m still learning how to balance the moments when I need to listen to my body and take a break, and when I need to push through discomfort and just do the work.
           </p>

           <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
           </strong>
           <p>As mentioned above, I don’t know if it would be possible to learn such a vast amount of information without also learning how to learn, how to handle emotions like frustration and self-doubt, 
             and learning how to ask for help when needed.
           </p>

           <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
           </strong>
           <p>It doesn’t feel like a waste - 
             although at the beginning of foundations I felt like the core curriculum wouldn’t teach me anything I didn’t already know, I’ve learned a lot in the last five weeks.
           </p>
           <p>
             Ultimately, learning to program is a useful skill, but not as time-sensitive as the core content, I believe. Online resources will always be available (touch wood),
              but the core curriculum is vital to making learning to program possible, I think.
              It’s not a step you can really skip, if you want to progress and improve your capability to learn.

        <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
        <h3>21 April 2022</h3>
        <p>
          These terms describe a way of arranging elements, such as paragraphs, images, or buttons, on a webpage. 
          Inline elements, like links, will display on the same line on a website, and can have items either side. <span class="red-border">
            For example, this is an inline element. (With a handy dandy red border.)
          </span>
          Inline elements are unable to be given heights, so that they won't disrupt the arrangement of the lines around them.
          </p>
          
          <p>The opposite of inline elements are block elements.
          Block elements will always stack on top of each other (like a stack of toy blocks), even if there's room to fit side by side. 
          They can be given height, and they will default to displaying 100% wide - taking up the whole page. <div class="red-border">Here's an example of a block element, with that handy border. It's totally messed with the margins of the paragraph underneath, too - unwieldy bastard.</div>
          Elements have a default display mode - for example, paragraphs are block elements, because it makes sense for new paragraphs to be on a new line, and blocks will force a new line.
          </p>
          <p>
          Inline-block takes attributes from both inline and block (as the name might suggest).
          Elements can be displayed on the same line, but their size can be modified to a much greater extent than inline elements. 
          Inline-block is what I've used to create the nav-bar on this website - here's the relevant code, if you're interested.
         </p>

         <p>All hail inline-block.

        <h2>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h2>
        <h3>21 April 2022</h3>
        <p>

<Strong> Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action. </Strong> <br>
<br>
During the August lockdown in 2021, I decided to get back in touch with a friend from highschool - we’d had a bit of a friendship break up in our final year, but I was conscious of how much I’d changed in the four years since then, and I wanted to find out if she had also changed, and if there was an opportunity to reconnect. 
<br><br>
We chatted for about two weeks, but then she stopped replying. This had been a common situation when we were in high school, and I got the sense that she was struggling a bit with anxiety and felt anxious about replying after too much time had passed. 
I had a lot of feelings about it, mostly tied up in how we’d behaved towards each other in school, and I ended up writing it all out in my diary.
I wrote about how I wasn’t sure I could forgive her for some things, but I’d like to try forget them and start anew.
<br><br>
I ended up sending her the diary entry, so that she knew exactly how I felt. I got a lot of peace from being so explicitly open about how I felt, but I didn’t receive a reply.
In the letter I’d also talked about how I planned to keep reaching out to her unless she actually asked me to stop, because I knew the reason she wasn’t replying was probably nothing to do with me and more about how she was feeling.
I kept reaching out for maybe the next two weeks, but it took a bit of energy from me every time I extended myself and got no reply. Eventually, I sent a message saying that while I was always available if she needed something, I couldn’t keep reaching out like that.
It was a hard decision to make - it felt like abandoning someone who probably needed support and a friend to talk to, but at the same time, I knew that it wasn’t a constructive thing for me personally to be doing - sometimes it felt like talking to a brick wall, and I was also struggling a bit with my own depression during lockdown.
I’d done all I could but to keep trying with nothing changing seemed useless.
<br><br>
When I was back home for Christmas, I got in touch again and suggested we catch up in person. We grabbed a coffee together, and had a good chat, but didn’t touch on a lot of the stuff I’d mentioned in my letter. She told me the reason she’d stopped replying was due to some things happening in her own life and had nothing to do with me, and that she was really grateful I’d been so persistent. She told me she’d actually written a letter as a reply to mine but not felt confident enough to send it, then promised to send it when she got home.
<br><br>
When we parted, she stopped replying again. I didn’t receive the letter, and I was really disappointed. I’d got my hopes up that we would be friends again, but it didn’t happen.
I still have no idea why that is, but I keep sending the odd message about a film I’ll watch or something I’ve seen, just in case she replies. 
<br><br>
Although this seems contradictory to the previous choice I made, I think it aligns closer to my values of kindness and persistence. I no longer invest so much energy into these messages, or care too much about whether there’s a response, but I feel like I’m keeping my word, and hopefully when she’s ready she’ll reply. I feel like while I have the mental energy to be doing it, it’s the right thing to do, and it makes me feel better about myself.
<br><br>

<strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity. </strong> <br>
<br>I feel like culture has a few potential meanings. <br>
In terms of a wider ethnic culture - <br>
My background is that my mother was pakeha, and my father is irish.
I feel like pakeha culture in New Zealand suffers a bit from disconnect with our ancestors or culture. I find it hard sometimes to be proud of an ancestry which depends on stolen land and exploitation, although obviously there's a lot more nuance than that. One thing I am proud of is the leap into the unknown so many early settlers took.
On the other hand, I feel a lot of connection to my Irish ancestry, particularly because I lived in Ireland for two years. I play Irish traditional music, and I enjoy the feeling of knowing that I’m continuing a tradition that has lasted hundreds of years, and contributing to that tradition.
I think that there are also aspects of Irish culture I’m proud to embody - love of fun, being a good host, a massive history of storytellers and poets.
<br><br>The multicultural aspect of this lineage is something I’ve struggled with sometimes. When I was in Ireland, I didn’t feel Irish - I felt like a Kiwi. But when I came home, I no longer felt like a Kiwi - I had an accent, and people would ask me where I was <em>really</em> from (which was admittedly hilarious). 
However, I feel like this heritage has given me much more awareness of how people’s opinions are shaped by where they’re from, and a lot more tolerance for people I don’t fully understand, as a result.
<br><br>
In terms of a family culture growing up-<br>
I grew up in an environment that rewarded hard work, and academic achievement. I frequently associate achievement or external validation with self worth as a result, which I’ve only recently become aware of. I don’t think it’s an entirely bad thing, but self knowledge is always useful.
I also grew up in a very musical household, and I think that this resulted in valuing the ability to entertain others, whether that’s with music or humour.
I’m very close to my family, and I think this has set me up to really value close connections with people. I feel like when I’m in a group of people, it’s greater than the sum of its parts, and that’s one of my favourite things about humanity, honestly.
<br><br>
<strong>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</strong><br>
<br>Strengths:<br><br>
Communication<br><br>
I’m aware that I’m fortunate enough to be able to convey the way that I think and feel with a lot of accuracy. I’m able to use language to express meaning and beauty, and I love that about myself. I know that this is something many others struggle with, so it’d be good to explore the ways in which I can use my strength in this to help others, without speaking for them or over them.
<br><br>
Networking<br><br>
I’m good with people (a gross generalisation). I’m able to present a version of myself that’s likeable, and use humour as a way to break the ice. In an extension of the “everyone has something to teach you” maxim, I think that most people also enjoy the feeling of having taught or given someone else something really valuable. I like to ask people a lot of questions, find a topic they have expertise on, and learn from them. Even if what I learn isn’t useful or I already know it, it’s an opportunity to make a connection with someone, and it means that they’ll likely remember me. 
<br><br>
Quick learner<br><br>
I read and absorb information at a really high speed, and while this doesn’t always equate to instant ability, I think it does give me an edge in a lot of cases. Because I’ve read a lot, I also tend to recognise a lot of patterns in things like etymology and recognition of themes and motifs in literature. I’m curious to see if this transfers well into the tech field - if I can apply memory and prior knowledge to problem solving and troubleshooting.
<br><br>
Limitations:<br><br>
My pride makes it hard to ask for help and express vulnerability- I often want to  protect my image as someone who’s always competent and in control. I think that if I’m a student it feels easier to ask for help - the frameworks are all set up and I know that it’s the smart thing to do.
<br><br>
Procrastination - I sometimes delay easy tasks for ridiculous amounts of time. I find it hard to motivate myself to do boring tasks without time pressure. I’m sure that this will surface during the time of the course, but I’m confident that the motivation of learning as much as possible in order to find a job at the end will help wit this, and I got a lot out of the prep materials which talked about methods of time management.
<br><br>
Impatience - this varies depending on my mental state - it’s a sign I need to do something in life differently if I notice I’m becoming frustrated easily or have less tolerance for others’ mistakes. Usually the fix involves exercising or meditating, but even at the best of times I’m aware that I tend towards impatience - I like to think that I channel this into being as efficient as practical.
<br><br>


<strong>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</strong> <br>
<br>I think that my communication skills are going to be really helpful in group work - I’m normally quite good at working with others towards a goal. I’m aware that bootcamp can be quite an intense and stressful experience, so I’d like to use these skills to be able to start discussions with members of my cohort and homegroup about how we’re all doing, and seeing if we can help each other out.
I’d like to use my networking skills to learn from other students as much as possible, and identify who has expertise on particular topics. I know that there’s people from a very wide range of backgrounds on the course, and I think that particularly for projects, playing towards strengths and covering each others blind spots could be the best approach.
I’d like to use my ability to learn to find out more about all the different career options - front end, app development, etc, and research more about anything that interests me, and that I’d like to specialise in. Currently I’m quite interested in the software behind audio-reactive visuals, as I’ve used a few different types before, but I expect my horizons will be broadened considerably over the next four months.
<br><br>

<strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</strong> <br>
<br>When I was working in a lighting warehouse, we often hired local crew to load trucks if it was a busy day, so that we could prep equipment. Someone has to oversee them, and I’d met some people that were quite good at it, but I struggled a bit. I tried to tell four men, all older than me, some of them by a significant amount, that the easiest way to load the truck would be to start loading cases from the sides and then work their way in, so they had more room to work. I was promptly ignored, and rather than stressing the point, I figured that if they wanted to make it harder for themselves, so be it.
I didn’t lose much sleep over it - I was told that the more you work with local crew, the better you get, and I didn’t have much experience at the time.
<br><br>
If I were to do it again, I think I would’ve made more of an effort to connect with the guys before telling them what to do - I didn’t even get their names I think, it was a busy day. 
Watching others work with local crew later on, I paid more attention to how they handled it, and being able to have a laugh around with them definitely made cooperation easier.
Five minutes of small talk might’ve made a difference, or it might not have. 
There were plenty of people who didn’t want to be told what to do by a nineteen year old girl, and I tended to make more of an effort with people I’d be working with long term.

      <h2>Javascript Fundamentals</h2>
<h3>1 May 2022</h3>
<p>
  <strong>How does Javascript relate to HTML and CSS?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A good analogy to describe the relationship between these three would be to imagine them as parts of a body. 
  HTML is the bones, providing structure, the core upon which other things rest. Each bone or joint has a specific movement or range of motion, but they are limited in what they can do.
  We might say that CSS is like the skin, or perhaps the clothing on the body. Easily customisable, yet it doesn't affect the function of other parts (we'll leave the concept of skinny jeans out of this metaphor haha).
  Javascript, that beautiful beast, is like the brain. It it responsible for guiding the bones/HTML in what to do. Our bodies can do incredibly complex things, much of it beneath the surface.
   However, without our brains to drive this, nothing would be able to happen.
</p>
<p><strong>Explain control flow and loops, using an example process</strong></p>
<p>Control flow refers to the order in which javascript is executed. This could be sequential (one thing after another), or it could be conditional - a loop that will run until it meets conditions that will allow it to stop.
  Several aspects of everyday life also conform to these orders. For example, we follow a recipe in a sequential order - the first steps must be completed in order to do the next.
   However, we might describe the process of cooking someting in the oven as conditional. That loop goes like this: Check on bread. If cooked, take out of oven. Else leave for ten more minutes. This loop could be repeated (and has been, in my kitchen) again and again, until it's allowed to stop (the bread is cooked).
</p>
<p><strong>Descibe what the DOM is and an example of how it could be interacted with</strong></p>
<p>The DOM, short for Document Object Model, is a way of navigating and interacting with the parts that make up a web page (the "document"). This includes how different coding languages will affect each other.
  For example, you could use Javascript to continually update values written in a HTML file. Without the DOM, there would be no way to access the HTML in order to modify it using Javascript.  </p>
  <p><strong>What's the difference between accessing data from arrays, vs from objects?</strong></p>
  <p>When we access data from arrays, we can use the index number of that data, keeping in mind that arrays will count data beginning with zero. This is great when we want, say, the fifth item in a list, or we want to access them all in order.
    When we access data from objects, however, we do it using their properties - we ask for information like name, or age. This is better if we need that specific information.
  </p>
  <p><strong>What are functions, and why are they helpful?</strong></p>
  <p>A function in Javascript is a series of instructions that will be carried out when that function is called, or invoked. This could be by typing code, or it could be an automatic response to an event like a mouse click or button press.
  Functions can be as simple or complex as you like - one of the most commonly used functions is <em>console.log()</em>, which prints whatever's inside the brackets to the console. 
  Functions always follow the formula of name + round brackets, and inside the brackets is where we define parameters for the function. These parameters are referred to as arguments when we give them values when calling a function.
  These arguments could be numbers the function will add together, or information in the form of strings, or other types of values.
  Functions are one of the big building blocks of Javascript - often a series of very simple functions will combine to create something quite complex.

            <h2>
              Emotional Intelligence
            </h2>
            <h3>
              25 April 2022
            </h3>
            <p>
              <strong> What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong> <br>
              When we describe someone as emotionally intelligent, we’re referring to their ability to recognise their emotions and those of others. Although we can’t always control what emotions we feel, being aware of them can be the first step to regulating them. Empathy is far easier once we are able to understand what others may be feeling - this also helps judge the mood of groups. We are influenced by the emotions and actions of those around us, so being able to read a room, or pick up on potential conflicts before they escalate, is a good skill to have.
              <br>
              Our emotional intelligence often stems from our parents’ behaviour - the first people to model social interactions for us when we’re young - even if we were too young to consciously remember. However, “EQ” can also be taught. Anger management classes are a good example of this -teaching how to recognise our emotions and find less harmful ways of dealing with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How is it different to IQ?</strong><br>
              IQ is widely considered to test how “smart” someone is. However, it tests a limited field of knowledge - mostly analytical abilities and logical problem solving.
      IQ tests can also have the flaw of being biased towards test-takers with a particular upbringing - such as growing up within a western culture. It’s hard to test for knowledge people “should know”, such as current politicians, or historical events, without falling into this bias.
      <br>
      It’s widely accepted nowadays that, although useful, this is not the only type of knowledge with value - working well with others, and even navigating most facets of everyday life, are made easier if you are able to empathise and relate to others - social, or emotional intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why is it important?</strong><br>
            Although humans are capable of incredible things individually, I feel like our greatest achievements result from many people working together. However, in order to work together effectively, we need more than just IQ. Emotional intelligence can optimise our social interactions, play a vital role in self-development, and result in higher productivity.
            <br>
            Often I would prefer to be around someone who is easy to get along with (aka emotionally intelligent) rather than someone with a high IQ. Even if I’m working on a problem with someone else with a really high IQ, if they don’t have the skills to effectively communicate their ideas in a way I’ll understand, it’ll be really hard to work together. I know that if I feel this way, it’s likely others do too, including people I might like to be employed by.

                    Learning Plan for Bootcamp
              
                  </h2>
                  <h3>21 April 2022</h3>
                  <p>
                    <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong> <br><br>
          Long-term goal is to be a professional software developer - I’m not yet sure what I’d like to specialise in - 
          possibly something that will play to my comms strengths, such as an analyst or consultant. 
          I want to be good enough that I can ask to work remotely, eventually part-time. I have the dream of being a digital nomad.
          I know that one way to reach this point is to learn something that not many others know, rather than to try be the best in a massive field.
          <br>I’d like to see coding less as work and more as something enjoyable - I want to want to work on projects in my free time
          <br><br><strong>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</strong><br><br>
          My strengths include good communication, enthusiasm, and a tendency to obsess about a passion.
          My limitations include innate procrastination urges, reluctance to admit difficulty, and depressive episodes involving self sabotage.
          Throughout foundations, I've gained a clearer idea of these limitations - I struggle to complete work if I don't have a set deadline, and I struggle to resume a routine once it's been broken.<br><br>
          <strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong><br><br>
          I’d like to be able to facilitate multiple people working together, and create safe spaces for peers who might be too shy or nervous to contribute otherwise.     
          Already I feel like my time management has improved since starting this course - I’d like to learn more about my learning and working styles in order to maximize productivity while staying sane.
          I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be getting the work done on time, and also maintaining focus over the whole time period. I'm going to write out my future goals and keep on my desk as a reminer of why I'm doing this.
          <br><br>   
          <strong>A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</strong><br><br>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives: <br><br>
          Find effective tools to manage weaknesses - eg pomodoro for productivity<br>
          Clearly express boundaries and expectations before getting frustrated at others for what they’re unaware of<br><br>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you<br><br>
          Maintain other priorities alongside productivity - sleeping, eating, and exercising<br>
          Take a walk - be outside and away from tech for half an hour<br>
          Talk about it - reach out to others on the course (if they have the energy for it) or to my brother - discuss challenges and gain perspective<br>
          Reach out for help - admit difficulty to facilitators, or someone able to help. <br><br>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way<br><br>
          -If I need help, my first step will be to post in the relevant discord channel - I may get an answer from a peer or I might find several people are struggling with the same thing.<br>
          -the second step would be to get in touch with a facilitator, and have a chat or a call with them about it.<br>
          -I’d like to keep the process the same regardless of whether it’s a tech problem or more of a personal problem - I think that being open about struggles is worthwhile for the reassurance it brings others that they’re not alone if they’re struggling too.<br>
          -The “if you’re stuck on it for more than twenty minutes get help” rule has worked well for code problems so far - I might extend that to something like 24 hours for personal problems, or maybe just after sleeping on it - can see what a facilitator recommends here.<br><br>
          A description of what you expect from the facilitation team<br><br>
          From the facilitation team, I expect a willingness to help overcome obstacles, a reference point for the relevance of what I’m learning, someone to tell me when I’m overthinking stuff, and at least one decent joke per week

        <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3>2 May 2022</h3>
        <p><strong>Discuss how understanding the priciples of neuroplasticity benefits people</strong></p>
        <p>To understand the principles of neuroplasticity is to understand that we are capable of learning anything at any time - widespread ideas around “teaching old dogs new tricks”, notions of having an “artistic brain” or a “logical brain”, or of being smart vs slow, are mistaken. </p>
        <p>Our brains are not static - they adapt and grow as we use them, to be more efficient. Our knowledge is not fixed - we can train our brains to do whatever we want, through practice and conscious effort. The pathways of neurons in our brains are constantly being rewired, to support whatever we are using our brain for. This means that the more often we do something, the stronger those pathways become. This is also why things become easier over time, as these pathways become established.</p>
        <p>The understanding of these principles is important - they help to eliminate the self-critical thoughts that often come up while struggling to learn new things. “I’ll never be good at this”, “This is so new to me, I’ll never understand it”, “My brain just doesn’t work this way” - these statements are scientifically disproved by numerous studies on the nature of neuroplasticity.</p>
        <p><strong>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</strong></p>
        <p>For me, I frequently associate the feeling of struggling to learn something with failure - I’m very used to having things come quickly to me. To realise that the feeling of grappling with something is actually the feeling of my brain creating new neural pathways, is a far more inspiring way to look at things.</p>
        <p>The idea of salience affecting neuroplasticity also confirms something I’ve been suspecting lately - I find it easier to learn and stay engaged with something if it’s relevant to things I’m interested in, or if I can see the possible uses for it. In terms of learning to code, this means that I often understand something better after seeing it in context - although I’ll think I understand it after an isolated example, I get a lot more clarity after seeing it used, and I remember it better.</p>
        <p><strong>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</strong></p>
        <p>Regular practice of a new skill, such as coding. Skills need to be used, or the neural pathways will degrade, and new skills particularly so. Repetition helps reinforce these pathways - the more a skill is used, the better we get at it.</p>
        <p>Specifically practice what you want to get good at. It’s not enough to be on the computer all day - if I want to become good at coding, I need to be practicing coding. There’s not really a shortcut.</p>
        <p>	Practice also needs to be at the right level of intensity - the goldilocks zone which sits between the comfort zone and the panic zone - also known as the learning zone. We need to be challenged in order to learn, and the more challenging the tasks are, the faster we’ll learn, to a point. There’s got to be a certain level of comprehension  in order to move forward, obviously, but when you are struggling, that’s the feeling of learning.</p>

        <p><strong>Discuss what a Growth Mindest is and why it is relevant</strong></p>
        <p>A growth mindset is the belief that we are able to develop new skills and abiltiies, that we can learn from our mistakes, and that we can continue to grow as people as we go through life - we’re not stuck with the same abilities and beliefs as we had when we were children, or when we became adults.</p>
        <p><strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong></p>
        <p>This exploration renewed my determination to overcome challenges I might face. Although the content wasn’t too surprising, I’m aware that there are aspects of a growth mindset that I could integrate more fully into my life. </p>
        <p><strong>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong></p>
        <p>At the beginning of this course, I wrote out the principles of a growth vs fixed mindset, on a postick which I keep on my desk. The points that I know I need to work on are embracing challenges, persisting in obstacles, and seeing effort as necessary. I’m beginning to think that I might need these in a larger font, or possibly tattooed on my forehead. Although I can logically see the point of them, it’s easy to forget when I’m feeling strong emotions of frustration or anger. I think that continued mindfulness practice will help with this too.</p>
        <p><strong>Useful resource:</strong> <li><a href = "https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindset">Growth vs Fixed Mindset</a></li></p>
        <p><strong>Reflect and discuss how these understanndings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</strong></p>
        <p>In the context of these learnings, I feel like I should be making a greater effort to improve the way I approach challenges, to ensure that I’m using a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset. I think this could be my biggest challenge during this course. However I think it could also be the most useful thing I learn. I’m going to make an effort to remind myself of this every time I feel like giving up, or that something is too difficult. I’m going to try to keep in mind that learning takes effort, and although it won’t be easy all the time, it will be worth it. </p>

        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
        <h3>9 May 2022</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>On being blocked on a simple problem:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I feel like after this week I'm well qualified to talk about being blocked - a lot of time was spent in this state. The example that immediately springs to mind is a section of the Gradebook problem.
        </p>
        <p>The problem was to write a function that would average multiple scores and return one value. This seemed like a straightforward problem at the outset, and I had a clear idea of how to go about it.
          I used psuedocode to outline my approach, and then began writing the function. However, I kept encountering the error message "TypeError: Cannot read 'length' of undefined". My immediate reaction was to assume I had forgot something
           - some kind of connection between either the students' names and their scores, or that I wasn't accessing the scores in the right way. 
        </p>
        <p>I think I spent almost an hour trying to get to the bottom of this - although I was aware I should ask for help if I was stuck for a long time, I didn't really consider myself stuck.
          I felt like I could work out where I'd gone wrong through a process of trial and error, and I just had to keep trying possible solutions.
           When I finally realised I wasn't really getting anywhere, I compared code with a peer who was stuck on the same problem.
           I was able to spot what was wrong with her code, and she was able to pass the tests and solve the problem. This confused me even more.
        </p>
        <p>To my eyes, our code was almost identical, and now I knew I had the right approach, but my code was still throwing the same error message.
          However when my peer read over my code, she was almost immediately able to spot what I'd missed - I'd written a lowercase 's' where it should've been uppercase.
          A single character, derailing the entire averaging function I'd written. It was humbling to say the least.
          However, it drove home a valuable lesson - the value of double and triple checking spelling and syntax, before assuming the problem is more complex than it actually is.
          Had I checked my spelling at the beginning, I might have saved myself a considerable amount of time and frustration. 
          As it was, after an hour of staring at the same code, there was little chance I'd be able to spot something out of place. I was seeing what I wanted to see - perfectly normal code, and I thought that meant something else must be wrong.
          Lesson learnt, for now, although I don't doubt I'll repeat the error in the future at least once or twice.
         </p>
         <p>
           <strong>On elegantly solving a problem:</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
           The best example I can think of for this took place during the built-in methods challenge, while writing a capitalise function which would make the first letter of every word in a phrase start with a capital.
           At this stage of the built-in methods challenge, I was beginning to get an idea of which methods (common functions JavaScript has prewritten for people to use) would best suit each problem.
          </p>
          <p>Like the previous example, I began by outlining my approach in pseudocode. However I also included comments throughout the function, to help me keep track of what I was doing 
            - the function involved converting back and forth between different data types, and I knew I didn't want to get mixed up about what I was working with. 
            After writing my first attempt, I was reasonably sure I had solved the problem in the most efficient way, however it failed the tests.
            After checking my spelling and syntax and finding no faults, I googled the main matter I had some doubts about - whether I could use methods specific to a data type, within methods for other types.
            Google didn't provide a satifactory answer, so I also posted my question in the tech-questions Discord channel, with screenshots of my code.
          </p>
          <p>I got an answer quite quickly - my first instinct was right, but I'd just mixed up which variable the function was acting upon. This was a quick fix, after which my code passed the tests.
            I felt great afterwards - although I was initially hesitant about seeking help so quickly, it was ultimately the right decision 
            - solving a problem on the second attempt felt very close to solving a problem on the first attempt, and worth asking for help to save so much time trying to work out where I'd gone wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Confidence around problem solving techniques:</strong>
            <p>I feel like I gained a lot of confidence using most of the suggested methods. The ones that worked really well for me were using pseudocode, reading error messages, and googling.
              I think I have a tendency to jump right into trying something, possibly without giving it enough thought beforehand regarding viability and efficiency. 
              This is where asking for help was really useful - to try things while talking it through with a peer, or after some clues from a facilitator, was far more effective for me.
              I found that reflection was a useful way to improve my future problem solving, and ensure that I was learning from my mistakes as much as possible, but the rubber ducky method didn't work so well for me.
              I found it easier to talk through the problem while writing pseudocode rather that try to explain it - I can think much faster than I can talk.
              I'd like to use console.logging more - I only started using it close to the end but it helped significantly in diagnosing where exactly the problems were.

      <h2>The Story of Te Houtaewa</h1>
      <h3>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em> (Optional SUB title) </h2>
      <h4>20 April 2022</h3>
      
      <p>
        Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.

        "How can I--how could any one--tell of that strange scene, its solemnity, its gloom, its sadness, its horror; and, withal, its sweetness. Even a sceptic, who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady; or heard the tender passion of her husband's voice, as in tones so broken with emotion that often he had to pause, he read the simple and beautiful service from the Burial of the Dead. I--I cannot go on--words--and--v-voice--f-fail m-me!
