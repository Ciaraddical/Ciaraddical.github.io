         <strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
         </strong> 
         <p>1- a lot of my identity revolves around being seen to be smart - I find struggling to learn something really challenging
         </p>
         <p>2- I find helping others learn really rewarding - it increases my self-image in a constructive way
         </p>
         <p>3- I get a far greater sense of satisfaction when I solve something if I’ve struggled with it - the struggle seems worth it for the endorphin hit
         </p>
         
         <strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
        </strong> 
        <p>Values - I feel that if we have a clear understanding of our values and motivations we can approach something - 
          a project, or a problem, with more intent and self awareness. This aids in maintaining focus and encourages altruism
        </p>
        <p>Empathy - one of the keys to successful cooperation, the ability to step into someone else’s shoes is also useful while learning - 
          understanding the difference between how people learn also fosters self-compassion and a growth mindset.
        </p>
        <p>Self-awareness - programming seems to almost invariably lead to self-awareness - 
          we stare at code we imagine to be flawless for hours before someone else points out a mistake, and the realisation that we are viewing something with  warped senses falls into place.
          The value of self awareness in learning is equally vital - the ability to recognise patterns in the way we respond to 
          problems, stressors, and frustrations is the first step towards redirecting these responses in a more positive and constructive direction.
        </p>

        <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </strong>
        <p>I feel like core learning has filled gap in my knowledge that has been there for a while -
           ways to approach new knowledge, increase productivity, and deal with challenges - these were all things I had previously seen as somewhat hardwired.
          </p>
        <p>I feel like without the core curriculum I would have struggled significantly more with the volume of information we’re expected to learn,
            as well as the experience of self directed remote learning.</p>

            <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
            </strong>
            <p>
              It’s brought to light that a lot of the excuses I’ve been leaning on are actually surmountable problems, and that ultimately, I’m responsible for my successes and failures.
               This is a somewhat uncomfortable truth, and I’m still learning how to balance the moments when I need to listen to my body and take a break, and when I need to push through discomfort and just do the work.
            </p>

            <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
            </strong>
            <p>As mentioned above, I don’t know if it would be possible to learn such a vast amount of information without also learning how to learn, how to handle emotions like frustration and self-doubt, 
              and learning how to ask for help when needed.
            </p>

            <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </strong>
            <p>It doesn’t feel like a waste - 
              although at the beginning of foundations I felt like the core curriculum wouldn’t teach me anything I didn’t already know, I’ve learned a lot in the last five weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, learning to program is a useful skill, but not as time-sensitive as the core content, I believe. Online resources will always be available (touch wood),
               but the core curriculum is vital to making learning to program possible, I think.
               It’s not a step you can really skip, if you want to progress and improve your capability to learn.
