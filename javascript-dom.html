<h2>Javascript Fundamentals</h2>
<h3>1 May 2022</h3>
<p>
  <strong>How does Javascript relate to HTML and CSS?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A good analogy to describe the relationship between these three would be to imagine them as parts of a body. 
  HTML is the bones, providing structure, the core upon which other things rest. Each bone or joint has a specific movement or range of motion, but they are limited in what they can do.
  We might say that CSS is like the skin, or perhaps the clothing on the body. Easily customisable, yet it doesn't affect the function of other parts (we'll leave the concept of skinny jeans out of this metaphor haha).
  Javascript, that beautiful beast, is like the brain. It it responsible for guiding the bones/HTML in what to do. Our bodies can do incredibly complex things, much of it beneath the surface.
   However, without our brains to drive this, nothing would be able to happen.
</p>
<p><strong>Explain control flow and loops, using an example process</strong></p>
<p>Control flow refers to the order in which javascript is executed. This could be sequential (one thing after another), or it could be conditional - a loop that will run until it meets conditions that will allow it to stop.
  Several aspects of everyday life also conform to these orders. For example, we follow a recipe in a sequential order - the first steps must be completed in order to do the next.
   However, we might describe the process of cooking someting in the oven as conditional. That loop goes like this: Check on bread. If cooked, take out of oven. Else leave for ten more minutes. This loop could be repeated (and has been, in my kitchen) again and again, until it's allowed to stop (the bread is cooked).
</p>
<p><strong>Descibe what the DOM is and an example of how it could be interacted with</strong></p>
<p>The DOM, short for Document Object Model, is a way of navigating and interacting with the parts that make up a web page (the "document"). This includes how different coding languages will affect each other.
  For example, you could use Javascript to continually update values written in a HTML file. Without the DOM, there would be no way to access the HTML in order to modify it using Javascript.  </p>
  <p><strong>What's the difference between accessing data from arrays, vs from objects?</strong></p>
  <p>When we access data from arrays, we can use the index number of that data, keeping in mind that arrays will count data beginning with zero. This is great when we want, say, the fifth item in a list, or we want to access them all in order.
    When we access data from objects, however, we do it using their properties - we ask for information like name, or age. This is better if we need that specific information.
  </p>
  <p><strong>What are functions, and why are they helpful?</strong></p>
  <p>A function in Javascript is a series of instructions that will be carried out when that function is called, or invoked. This could be by typing code, or it could be an automatic response to an event like a mouse click or button press.
  Functions can be as simple or complex as you like - one of the most commonly used functions is <em>console.log()</em>, which prints whatever's inside the brackets to the console. 
  Functions always follow the formula of name + round brackets, and inside the brackets is where we define parameters for the function. These parameters are referred to as arguments when we give them values when calling a function.
  These arguments could be numbers the function will add together, or information in the form of strings, or other types of values.
  Functions are one of the big building blocks of Javascript - often a series of very simple functions will combine to create something quite complex.
