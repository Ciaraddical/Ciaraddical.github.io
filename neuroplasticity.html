<h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
<h3>2 May 2022</h3>
<p><strong>Discuss how understanding the priciples of neuroplasticity benefits people</strong></p>
<p>To understand the principles of neuroplasticity is to understand that we are capable of learning anything at any time - widespread ideas around “teaching old dogs new tricks”, notions of having an “artistic brain” or a “logical brain”, or of being smart vs slow, are mistaken. </p>
<p>Our brains are not static - they adapt and grow as we use them, to be more efficient. Our knowledge is not fixed - we can train our brains to do whatever we want, through practice and conscious effort. The pathways of neurons in our brains are constantly being rewired, to support whatever we are using our brain for. This means that the more often we do something, the stronger those pathways become. This is also why things become easier over time, as these pathways become established.</p>
<p>The understanding of these principles is important - they help to eliminate the self-critical thoughts that often come up while struggling to learn new things. “I’ll never be good at this”, “This is so new to me, I’ll never understand it”, “My brain just doesn’t work this way” - these statements are scientifically disproved by numerous studies on the nature of neuroplasticity.</p>
<p><strong>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</strong></p>
<p>For me, I frequently associate the feeling of struggling to learn something with failure - I’m very used to having things come quickly to me. To realise that the feeling of grappling with something is actually the feeling of my brain creating new neural pathways, is a far more inspiring way to look at things.</p>
<p>The idea of salience affecting neuroplasticity also confirms something I’ve been suspecting lately - I find it easier to learn and stay engaged with something if it’s relevant to things I’m interested in, or if I can see the possible uses for it. In terms of learning to code, this means that I often understand something better after seeing it in context - although I’ll think I understand it after an isolated example, I get a lot more clarity after seeing it used, and I remember it better.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</strong></p>
<p>Regular practice of a new skill, such as coding. Skills need to be used, or the neural pathways will degrade, and new skills particularly so. Repetition helps reinforce these pathways - the more a skill is used, the better we get at it.</p>
<p>Specifically practice what you want to get good at. It’s not enough to be on the computer all day - if I want to become good at coding, I need to be practicing coding. There’s not really a shortcut.</p>
<p>	Practice also needs to be at the right level of intensity - the goldilocks zone which sits between the comfort zone and the panic zone - also known as the learning zone. We need to be challenged in order to learn, and the more challenging the tasks are, the faster we’ll learn, to a point. There’s got to be a certain level of comprehension  in order to move forward, obviously, but when you are struggling, that’s the feeling of learning.</p>

<p><strong>Discuss what a Growth Mindest is and why it is relevant</strong></p>
<p>A growth mindset is the belief that we are able to develop new skills and abiltiies, that we can learn from our mistakes, and that we can continue to grow as people as we go through life - we’re not stuck with the same abilities and beliefs as we had when we were children, or when we became adults.</p>
<p><strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong></p>
<p>This exploration renewed my determination to overcome challenges I might face. Although the content wasn’t too surprising, I’m aware that there are aspects of a growth mindset that I could integrate more fully into my life. </p>
<p><strong>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of this course, I wrote out the principles of a growth vs fixed mindset, on a postick which I keep on my desk. The points that I know I need to work on are embracing challenges, persisting in obstacles, and seeing effort as necessary. I’m beginning to think that I might need these in a larger font, or possibly tattooed on my forehead. Although I can logically see the point of them, it’s easy to forget when I’m feeling strong emotions of frustration or anger. I think that continued mindfulness practice will help with this too.</p>

<p><strong>Reflect and discuss how these understanndings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</strong></p>
<p>In the context of these learnings, I feel like I should be making a greater effort to improve the way I approach challenges, to ensure that I’m using a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset. I think this could be my biggest challenge during this course. However I think it could also be the most useful thing I learn. I’m going to make an effort to remind myself of this every time I feel like giving up, or that something is too difficult. I’m going to try to keep in mind that learning takes effort, and although it won’t be easy all the time, it will be worth it. </p>
