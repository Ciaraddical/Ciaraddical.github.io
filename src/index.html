            </h1>
            <p class="p"> 
              Fresh off the press (AKA my computer), I've finally arrived at a version of a portfolio site where I have a design that I'm happy showing off. It's time for this website to leave the nest, so to speak. I plan to regularly add to this site, with a diverse collection of projects and inspiration sources which capture my attention.

                This design has been done in Tailwind CSS, which has been an interesting experience. Previously, I've only used Tailwind with a partial understanding, and a great deal of trial and error. Having a comprehensive understanding has made working with this framework so much easier, to the point where I now cannot imagine using bootstrap CSS. I started this process by reading Refactoring UI, by Adam Watham and Steve Schologer, and then created a wireframe in Figma, before beginning to code. When I first approached this redesign project I was determined not to create another blue and grey, neutral, cookie-cutter website. However, I discovered that, to my surprise, it is actually useful to know some design rules and guidelines before trying to break them. It's difficult to think outside the box when your conception of the 'box' is hazy at best.
