                This design has been done in Tailwind CSS, which has been an interesting experience. Previously, I've only used Tailwind with a partial understanding, and a great deal of trial and error. Having a comprehensive understanding of the scaling and colour systems within Tailwind has made working with this framework so much easier, to the point where I now cannot imagine using bootstrap CSS. When I first approached this redesign project I was determined not to create another blue and grey, neutral, cookie-cutter website (please ignore the fact that the colour scheme I eventually went for is, in fact, blue and gray). However, I discovered that, to my surprise, it is actually useful to know some design rules and guidelines before trying to break them. It's difficult to think outside the box when your conception of the 'box' is hazy at best. I started this process by reading Refactoring UI, by Adam Watham and Steve Schoger, and then created a wireframe in Figma, before beginning to code.

                There were a few headaches in the process - I used a grid while designing on Figma, but I don't have much experience actually using grids in Flexbox. I often lack the patience to learn everything I need to know before attempting something, which consistently comes back to bite me. Flexbox grid is on the list of things to learn - any page I insert an image into feels a bit hacky at the moment, which irks me, but my current priority is getting this semi-presentable, and improving it later. I'm avoiding making eye contact with the prospect of converting to React, although I know once I start it won't be so bad.

                I have a lot of work yet to do on this - I'm looking forward to attempting to include some 3D-rendered models using Three.JS, which I haven't touched in a while. Less exciting but probably of greater importance is converting to React, so that I can reuse components like the nav bar and background styling, without just copy-pasting code. There's also a lot more potential for styling once I start to complicate my content slightly - adding dropdown menus that link to specific blog posts, adding comments sections, etc. I'm looking forward to adding shadows and playing around with the visual heirarchy of the z-axis - I found it fascinating reading about how our eyes are drawn to items that appear closer, and all it takes to manufacture that illusion of closeness is adding different shadows for inset elements or elements we want to appear raised off the page. The mind absolutely boggles.

                Alright, I've got stuff to do, clearly. Bye.
